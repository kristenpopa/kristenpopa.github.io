A personal website has been a long time coming for me, and I'd started down the path a few times in my twenties, but what's finally gotten me into production was this simple idea that a personal website is an internet garden to be tended.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yea, I love making little tweaks to mine. Closest thing the web has to gardening</p>&mdash; Nabeel S. Qureshi (@nabeelqu) <a href="https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1662503299797643266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Yes, let me tend to my garden.

but it was acutely driven by some [Tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1662472627829739520?s=20). Actually, it was his [reply](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1662503299797643266) comparing maintenance of one's personal website to internet gardening that did it for me. Yes, let me tend to my garden.

Where do you start when building a website for yourself? Domain name purchase? Or, gosh, just domain name ideation? What a commitment. Hosting? A website builder? 
Yeesh. Analysis paralysis. This has always been the step--and it is basically step 0--that I've gotten stuck at before.

But of course, the answer for where to start is Reddit.
Some cursory Redditing led me to [GitHub Pages][github-pages-docs] + [Jekyll][jekyll-docs], which appealed for a couple of reasons:
1. It is free.
2. It is free.
3. I already had a personal GitHub account and am serviceable in my use of a CLI, Git, and GitHub.
4. <username>.github.io isn't exactly the chicest domain, but it sure lets me skip past the ideation of, commitment to, and purchase of a custom domain. And there is support for changing from that default to a custom domain, should I one day get my act together there.
5. The docs make it easy. [GitHub Pages Documentation][github-pages-docs]. From nothing to live site in literal minutes. And the [Jekyll Documentation][jekyll-docs] is well-integrated inside the GitHub Pages docs.  
6. Jekyll! No burden on me to style HTML. And thank god, or else the site would just look like [this](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) Not that there's anything wrong with that. But now my site is Xanga-fied! Jekyll generates my site, with an easy-to-understand-and-manipulate config and structure; all I do is add the content and pick my theme. Bless.
