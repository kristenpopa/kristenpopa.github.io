A personal website has been a long time coming for me, and I've started down the path a few times in the last decade, but it was acutely driven by [some Tweet](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1662472627829739520?s=20). Actually, it was his [reply](https://twitter.com/nabeelqu/status/1662503299797643266) comparing maintenance of one's personal website to internet gardening that did it for me. Yes, let me tend to my garden.

Where do you start when building a website for yourself? Domain name purchase? Or, gosh, just domain name ideation? What a commitment. Hosting? A website builder? 
Yeesh. Analysis paralysis. This has always been the step (and it is step 0) that I've gotten stuck at before.

But of course, the answer for where to start is Reddit.
Some cursory Redditing led me to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) + [Jekyll], which appealed for a couple of reasons:
1. It is free.
2. I already had a personal GitHub account and am serviceable in my use of a CLI, Git, and GitHub.
3. <username>.github.io isn't exactly the chicest domain, but it sure lets me skip past the ideation of, commitment to, and purchase of a custom domain. And there is support for changing from that default to a custom domain, should I one day get my act together there.
4. The docs. [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). From nothing to live site in literal minutes. And the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) docs are well-integrated inside the GitHub Pages docs.  
5. Jekyll! No burden on me to style html. And thank god, or else the site would just look like [this](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) Not that there's anything wrong with that. But now my site is Xanga-fied! Jekyll generates my site, with an easy-to-understand config and structure; all I do is add the content and pick my theme. Bless.
