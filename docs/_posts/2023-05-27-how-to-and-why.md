A personal website has been a long time coming for me. I'd started down the path a few times in my twenties, but what's finally gotten me into production was this simple, romantic idea that a personal website is an internet garden to be tended.

Yes, let me tend to my garden.


Where do you start when building a website for yourself? Domain name purchase? Or, gosh, just domain name ideation? What a commitment. Hosting? A website builder? Which one?
Yeesh. Analysis paralysis. This has always been the step (and it is really step 0) that I've gotten stuck at before.

But of course, the answer for where to start is Reddit.
Some cursory Redditing led me this time around to [GitHub Pages][github-pages-docs] + [Jekyll][jekyll-docs], which appealed for a couple of reasons:
1. It is free.
2. It is free.
3. I already had a personal GitHub account and am serviceable in my use of a CLI, Git, and GitHub.
4. "<username>".github.io isn't exactly the chicest domain, but it sure lets me skip past the ideation of, commitment to, and purchase of a custom domain. And there is support for changing from that default to a custom domain, should I one day get my act together there.
5. Ease. [GitHub Pages Documentation][github-pages-docs]led me from nothing to live site in literal minutes. And the [Jekyll Documentation][jekyll-docs] is well-integrated inside the GitHub Pages docs.  
6. Jekyll! No burden on me to style HTML. And thank god, or else the site would just look like [this](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) And, honestly, I was tempted, but I figured I ought to make some attempt at styling. Enter Jekyll, and now my site is Xanga-fied! Jekyll generates the site, with an easy-to-understand-and-manipulate configuration and structure; all I do is add the content and play around with themes. Bless it.
